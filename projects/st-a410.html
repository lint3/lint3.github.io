    <h1>ST-A410 Shimano Shifter/Brake Combo Repair</h1>
      <p>Published in the hope that someone else can use the info I've gained. The drawings are crappy but I think they'll get the point across OK.</p>
      <h2>Initial Issues</h2>
        <p>Part came off the <a href="/projects/bikes.html">Superstrada</a>. When cold, small (shift up) lever moves freely without doing anything.</p>
        <p>Replacement part: Allegedly the large (brake) lever didn't return back to neutral very well.</p>
      <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
        <div class="img-explainer"><p>There is a little part like this that's supposed to be pushed down by a spring, and engage with another part when the small shift lever is moved. In my assy, the spring (hooks on that notch) was all mangled, providing little to no torsion, and the lube was gummy. Therefore when the lever is pressed it didn't engage and slid right past.</p><img src="/assets/svg/st-a410/hook1.svg"></div>
