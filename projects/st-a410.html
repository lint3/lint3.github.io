    <h1>ST-A410 Shimano Shifter/Brake Combo Repair</h1>
      <p>(Right hand, rear derailleur) Published in the hope that someone else can use the info I've gained. The drawings are crappy but I think they'll get the point across OK.</p>
      <h2>Initial Issues</h2>
        <p>Part came off the <a href="/projects/bikes.html">Superstrada</a>. When cold, small (shift up) lever moves freely without doing anything.</p>
        <p>Replacement part: Allegedly the large (brake) lever didn't return back to neutral very well.</p>
      <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
        <div class="img-explainer"><p>There is a little part like this that's supposed to be pushed down by a spring, and engage with another part when the small shift lever is moved. In my assy, the spring (hooks on that notch) was all mangled, providing little to no torsion, and the lube was gummy. Therefore when the lever is pressed it didn't engage and slid right past.</p><img src="/assets/svg/st-a410/hook1.svg"></div>
        <p>Couldn't get the spring bent back into a usable shape. Couldn't find a good replacement spring online. So I bought a new-used assy on ebay for parts.</p>
      <h2>Disassembly</h2>
        <p>To get to the inner assy, see this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGNN_2CfCY">RJ video</a>. From there, the inner assembly (Part <code>6AE 9803</code>, "R.H. Release Lever Unit &amp; Small Parts") can be disassembled starting with the castle nut on the outside. I used a dremel with abrasive wheel to cut a little socket into the right shape, but I'm sure there's a tool for it.
