    <h1>Backpacking Gear</h1>
    
    <h2>My Shakedown</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Tent - Kelty Salida 2 - Cheap, reliable. By far my heaviest piece of gear.</li>
      <li>Backpack - Osprey Exos 48 - Old version with hip belt pockets. Bought used, never had any issue, the back ventilation is amazing.</li>
      <li>Quilt - Enlightened Equipment Revalation 10deg- wide / long - Great quilt, I'll never go back to a sleeping bag! This is a little hot for summer backpacking.</li>
      <li>Pad A - Therm-A-Rest Z-Lite - Indestructable, cheap, and lightweight. Not that comfy by itself, but works great with another pad. Quite bulky.</li>
      <li>Pad B - Therm-A-Rest Trail-Lite (I think?) - Decent R-value, fairly small when packed, but not amazing</li>
      <li>Stove - GoatBone in a Toaks 750ml pot - Insanely small and light, there are some tradeoffs like inability to simmer or turn off, but they are 100% worth it. Fuel can be bought at any convenience store and doesn't require a pressurized metal canister.</li>
      <li>Flashlight - Zebralight H600D - Extremely durable, excellent battery life, free up your hands. I've used and abused this light for about 6 years and it's never let me down. Excellent UI.</li>
      <li>Jacket - Patagonia Nano Puff - Bought used, layering makes this a 4-season item for me. They repaired a small barbed-wire rip for free.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Wishlist</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Tent - 1 person UL - Durston X-Mid 1, Lunar Solo, etc.</li>
      <li>Pad - Something thick and uninsulated for summer use</li>
      <li>Quilt - Something very small and light for summer/desert use (don't need much)</li>
      <li>Pack - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAtzN_ScKXY">Flextrek 37,000,000,000,000 Whipsnake Edition</a></li>
    </ul>
