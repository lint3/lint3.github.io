    <h1>Camp Meals</h1>
    <p>Some of the best recipes and ideas I've come across for backpacking and car camping.</p>
    <h2>Backpacking</h2>
      <p>Focus on high calorie to gram ratio. Things that cook "instantly" like instant rice, ramen noodles, freeze dried stuff, etc.</p>
      <h3>Breakfast</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Oatmeal is the classic. It can be upgraded with all kinds of stuff to add protein, flavor, etc.
            <ul>
              <li>Put a packet or two in a zip bag with some regular rolled oats. Improves texture</li>
              <li>Chia coconut oatmeal (Skurka)</li>
              <li>Ultralight cappucino oatmeal</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Skurka has a few more ideas I haven't tried</li>
          <li>Mountain House "breakfast skillet" dumped into a tortilla</li>
          <li>Throw granola and milk powder into a zip bag. Then just dump that and water into a bowl.</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Lunch</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Bagels with meat is the classic. Calorically dense, doesn't get crushed in bag, easy to prep and eat.
            <ul>
              <li>Packaged tuna, salmon, and chicken comes in a lot of different flavors.</li>
              <li>Chicken/pork spread that comes in a can with a devil on it tastes amazing on the trail.</li>
              <li>Spam comes in packets too</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Pre-packed sandwiches for the first day or two</li>
          <li>Mini pizza wraps - tomato sauce, cheese, pepperoni in a tortilla</li>
          <li>Summer sausage, cheese, mustard on tortilla or bagel</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Dinner</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Skurka Beans, Rice, and Cheese</li>
          <li>Pasta carbonara</li>
          <li>Ramen noodles in pot, or cup/bowl noodle. Can be upgraded with all kinds of stuff</li>
          <li>Canned chili (desert only)</li>
          <li>Instant mashed potatoes or stuffing</li>
          <li>Mix packaged chicken with BBQ sauce packets, eat on rolls</li>
          <li>Knorr spanish rice with BBQ tuna packet, put on tortillas</li>
          <li>Mountain House for a meal or two</li>
          <li>Chicken marbella</li>
          <li>Jambalaya w/ smoked sausage etc.</li>
          <li>Backcountry chili (Skurka)</li>
        </ul>
