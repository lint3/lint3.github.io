          <li>Amazing food everywhere you go.</li>

          <li>No enforced traffic rules, no personal space or expectation of politeness on sidewalks, roads, or really anywhere</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Adjustments, cultural and otherwise</h2>
        <i>From the perspective of a white american dude, lol</i>
        <ul>
          <li>Cleanliness. We were advised not to drink any tap water and to be careful what we eat. The assumption that stuff is clean unless marked otherwise is something I've absolutely taken for granted in the US, and was therefore kind of always on our minds while in India. Even after being (what I thought was) pretty cautious, I got a little of the runs toward the end. Fortunately this seemed to have been cancelled out by the ol' air-travel-constipation&#8482;! Haha.</li>
          <li>Non-verbal Communication. We noted that this makes up a larger importance in India. A quick sideways head-tilt in American culture signals doubt, "duh", or other mildly rude things where we're from. There it means "OK" or "Understood". Also, while on the street, or anywhere else with other people, I felt constantly in the way. I did notice that in the same situations, locals don't seem to feel the same discomfort.</li>
          <li>English. English is one of the national languages of India, so many people technically speak it at least partially, but the dialect can be hard to understand at times. The "D" sound seems easier/more common to speak there, so it's often used instead of "T" sound. Example: I was failing to understand for an embarrassingly long time what a guy explaining "dhee" to me meant. (tea)</li>
          <li>Similarities. I believe that in general, people are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_Law">"helpful, friendly, courteous, kind"</a> - every time I travel to a new part of the world, this belief is further cemented.</li>
        </ul>
