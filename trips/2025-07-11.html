      <h1>Sawtooths Toxaway Lake</h1>
      <p>Summary: Overnighter at Toxaway Lake. Originally planned for 2 days, but decided to cut it short because of barn fever, bugs, and lack of cookstove.</p>
      <h3>2025-07-11 Friday</h3>
      <p>Left home 6:00. Uneventful drive, stopped in Ketchum (Sun Valley) for deli sandwich lunch. At Pettit Lake, it is very busy, no parking at trailhead. Took the very rough road to Yellow Belly trailhead and loaded gear into packs. I realized I left the alcohol stove and pot at home.</p>
      <p>We drove to Redfish Lake, which was a madhouse, but found only T shirts, sunscreen, etc for sale. So we drove out to Stanley and found a very expensive MSR cook kit, but decided to cold soak or borrow instead. We had an aluminum can I cut to burn alcohol in poorly. Drove to lower Hell Roaring Lake TH and started our hike.</p>
      <p>Hiked past Hell Roaring Lake to Imogene Lake, asking a few day hikers along the way if they would sell us a steel water bottle. No dice. (No one had anything we could use.) Camped at Imogene, and borrowed a pot from our neighbors. Only got singed a couple times, but spilled hot water on my hand from jerking back reflexively. Skurka beans (hot!) for dinner.</p>
      <p>Trying to hang food in a tree, I got the rope stuck on a high branch. Ended up cutting it off after breaking the (paracord) sheath, leaving 9 tiny strings, about 8 feet each to work with. The mosquitoes were terrible. Starting to lose my mind, I tied up the pack at eye level using two strings to at least keep the rodents out, and ran back to the tent at about 8:30.</p>
      <h3>2025-07-12 Saturday</h3>
      <p>Up early, maybe 6:00. Neither of us slept very well. Packed up and started soaking oatmeal in an extra nalgene. Over the pass to Edith Lake where we ate breakfast and filtered water. Cold oatmeal is gross and slimy.</p>
      <p>Hiked to Toxaway, then it was suggested we cut the trip short to be in bed that night. Barn fever strikes again. On our way out, after filtering water I decided to beat the heat and jump into a bubbling pool section of the river - Best decision I made the whole trip. My wet clothes kept me perfectly cool for about an hour of hiking.</p>
      <p>Made it to the car and drove home, arrived about 10 PM.</p>
